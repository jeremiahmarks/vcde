You can thank MLUGO for the name.

Welcome to EmailMcAutoEmail, a quick script which will 
accept a backstop report and send emails to the service 
providers, TL, L2, and others (as needed) based on 
SR sub-status. It will also keep stats. It may group all of
the SRs into one email, or it may not. That is TBD.

Either way, this will consist of a script and several 
templates. The different templates will be used as 
dictated by the substatus. (ie you can have a template
for No ETA and another for New ETA needed.)

Templates will have a basic templating language with 
variables like %SCNAME% to denote where the SC name will go.

There should be a part that keeps statistics on how long each
SR has been being emailed  (IE: This is the eighth email for this SR)
