#Welcome to my Vixxo code repo

This repo contains the code to automatically find the most recent surveys report,
assign the surveys to agents, close the surveys which are too old to survey, upload
the assigned surveys to google docs, and, finally, to send an email with the 
survey assignments to the floor. 

In order to get this code up and running you will need to 

* [Download and install Anaconda3
for Windows 64bit](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Basically ensure that you are using
the installer for Python 3.6+ and 64-bit Windows.
* Clone and extract this repo into a folder that you know where it is. 
* Create a folder in your home directory named "surveyMagic"
